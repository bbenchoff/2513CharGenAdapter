# ADM-3a-Lowercase-ROM

An adapter to use a 2716 UV-erasable EPROM as a Signetics 2513 character generator.

---

Useful for the ADM-3a Dumb Terminal, but also applicable to other computer-like devices utilizing the 2513 such as the Apple 1, Apple ][ and Apple ][+. All you need to do is burn the ROM (in the relevant directory) and solder everything together.
